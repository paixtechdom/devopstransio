So, if one part needs fixing or an upgrade, the rest of the machine can keep running smoothly",

                    "Scalability is another major advantage. If one part of your app gets a lot of traffic, like a payment system during a big sale, you can scale just that part up. This is more efficient and cost-effective than scaling the entire app, which you would have to do with a monolithic structure.",
                    "To start with microservices, begin by looking at your current app and identifying which parts can be separated into independent services. These are usually distinct functions like user authentication, payment processing, or inventory management.",
